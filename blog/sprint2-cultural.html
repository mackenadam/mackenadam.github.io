            <p>
                My long-term career goal is to become a competent full-stack web developer. I would like to be able to have the skills, and the flexibility, to work on any part of a project. My hope is that being able to experience a variety of different technologies, skills, and job descriptions, will keep me interested in my career development for many years to come. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that I am creative, open-minded, and flexible. With these skills I can help develop ideas within a team, and am good at changing a plan on the fly so that an end goal can still be achieved. I am dedicated and hardworking, and wonâ€™t stop until my desired outcome is achieved. However, I also have equally high expectations of those around me and this can come across as too idealistic. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A personal skill that I would like to focus on is communicating as a developer; giving and receiving relevant feedback without taking it as a personal attack, and being able to translate an idea to another person. A non-technical skill that I think would be beneficial to cultivate now would be working within a practical timeframe; I am guilty of often getting too involved in a single idea, to the point where I focus on that to the exclusion of all else.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to get the most out of my time at EDA. That being said I am also aware that every other student has the same right. I will be committed to keeping up with everything that is expected of me in both personal and group projects. I will be available, at a minimum, from 8am until 5pm every weekday. I will also allocate time outside of this as it is needed, and as I am available, to complete tasks and help other students with their learning wherever I can. I will also be mindful of how my attitude affects other students and helps, or hinders, their learning objectives. I will work together with EDA staff to resolve any issues that arise and do my best to make sure this is not just a positive learning experience for myself and other students, but also a positive working environment for EDA staff. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to know when you are struggling and when to seek help. I will be mindful of my workflow, and when problems arise, I will seek advice at the earliest possible chance. If unforeseen circumstances arise, I will do everything in my power to mitigate them. I will do my best to notice when other students, or staff, are struggling and provide any assistance I can. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I expect the same level of commitment from the EDA facilitation team. I expect them to hold themselves accountable for providing a positive learning environment, and to resolve any issues as quickly as possible. I also expect that when problems arise they will also seek advice at the earliest possible chance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold myself accountable for my learning experience, and the experience of those around me, and I will do everything I can to make this a positive experience for everyone involved. 
            </p>
