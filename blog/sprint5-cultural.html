        <h2>What did I learn about myself?</h2>
        <p>
          During foundations I learnt alot about myself and how far I have come on this journey. There were a few difficult moments but overall I feel a lot more confident in my abilities heading into bootcamp. In sprint one we took a deep dive in to who I am and where I developed my identity. It wasn't something I had really thought about too deeply before but I think the experience helped me to better understand my strengths and weaknesses and what I need to be going forward.

        <h2>Values, empathy, and self awareness</h2>
        <p>
          The skills I learnt in the core section of foundations have set me up to better communicate with the people I will work with. Knowing what my values, morals, and ethics are will help me to maintain a level of professional integrity. Having empathy will help me to better understand the needs of both customers and colleagues. And being self aware will let me know what my strengths and weaknesses are and how best to leverage these to achieve my goals.
        </p>

      <div class="col-md-12 blog-paragraph">
        <h2>Challenges and surprises</h2>
        <p>
          There were plenty of challenges so far but I feel as though I have developed skills to deal with them much better. It wasn't easy to acknowledge my faults but I was also surprised how beneficial it can be to do just that. I feel as though the tech skills of foundations have helped me develop methods to solve problems and the core section rounds this out by helping me be able to realise when my weaknesses might be the problem and to better cope with them. Overall, I think the core skills are just as, if not more, important than the technical skills and I will make an effort to further develop them so that I can be the best version of myself.
