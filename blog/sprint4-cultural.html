        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the process of strengthening neural networks in the brain. When you understand the
          principles of neuroplasticity you are able to engage in more of the activities which promote it and avoid the
          activities that are detrimental to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more often you practice a task the more often the neurons are fired and the stronger the connections
          become. Even performing the task mentally stimulates the neurons in a way similar to actually physically
          performing the task. Therefore, committing to practice skills on a regular basis will be the cornerstone of my
          approach throughout my learning journey. Additionally, reflection will allow me to reinforce skills and ideas
          that I have already learnt. And finally, mental practice will become my method of practice when I don’t have
          access to the equipment for physical practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oddly enough, improving the performance of your brain is not just limited to mental exercises. In fact,
          studies have shown that cardiovascular exercise promotes the release of a substance known as BDNF, Brain
          Derived Neurotropic Factor. BDNF encourages growth and differentiation of new neurons and brain cells and
          increases the longevity of existing connections. Furthermore, participating in positive social interactions
          and play, and avoiding stressful environments are also shown to have a positive impact on BDNF levels.

        <h2>The Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is the idea that an individual’s intelligence isn’t fixed but malleable and that we can
          improve our abilities. Simply knowing that their abilities are capable of being improved can change a person’s
          goals from performance to learning orientated. When a person is focused on performance goals they may avoid
          challenging work in an attempt to appear intelligent to others. When learning goals are introduced however a
          person will actively seek out interesting and challenging tasks as an opportunity to better themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going forward I think it is important for me to focus on pushing myself to attempt harder challenges. I have
          always enjoyed learning and improving but over the last few years I have definitely been guilty of pushing
          myself just enough. Looking back, some of the most rewarding experiences throughout my life have been when I
          have been really challenged; often uncomfortably so. From these experiences I have learnt that I am resilient
          enough to bend without breaking and I think life is more rewarding when you challenge yourself to do, and be,
          better.
