        <h2>What is EQ?</h2>
        <p>
          EQ, or Emotional Intelligence, is defined at EDA as:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          "The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use
          this information to guide one’s thinking and actions”<br />
          Salovey and Mayer 1990
        </p>
        <p>
          A person's Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EQ), and their Intelligence Quotient (IQ), make what is know as
          their General Intelligence. Where IQ deals with cognitive abilities such as visual processing, working memory,
          and reasoning skills, EQ covers abilities like being able to relate to others, identifying emotions, and
          social communication skills. Originally it was thought that IQ was the defining factor in predicting a
          person's potential for success. However, many Psychologists now recognise that IQ alone does not cover the
          full spectrum of the human experience and, as such, now believe EQ to be an equally important factor.

      <div class="col-md-12 blog-paragraph">
        <h2>What can EQ do for me?</h2>
        <p>
          EQ determines many factors about a person. Initiative, self-confidence, influence, drive, and personal
          standards are all strongly correlated to EQ. Furthermore, people with a strong understanding of emotional
          intelligence are more likely to hold leadership roles, and are happier overall.

      <div class="col-md-12 blog-paragraph">
        <h2>What if I don't have EQ?</h2>
        <p>
          Like most skills EQ is trainable; with practice, and perseverance, you can improve your emotional
          intelligence. Three common methods used to improve EQ are Attention Training, Conscious Listening, and
          Journaling. There are many resources devoted to these practices and by using one that you enjoy you can begin
          to develop your skills.
