              When you first jump into CSS you might be a bit confused when it comes to padding and margins. On the surface of it they seem to both deal with the same thing; the space around the element you are trying to style. However, there are a couple of key differences between the two which make them behave very differently. In this technical blog we will look at some of the differences between the two and a few use cases.

Think of your content as an important object you are sending out for delivery. The padding is like the bubble-wrap surrounding your important object, and the border is the box it is delivered in. It provides a gap between the object and the box so it the package is dropped then the contents aren't damaged. Now, our padding doesn't actually physically protect the content in any way but  It follows all the rules laid out for the
